          My name is Aryanata Andipradana, but you can call me Ryan. I am a Web
          Developer at a company that focuses on web application development.
        </p>
        <p className="text-xl mb-8">
          In my current role, I build various web applications and provide the
          best experience in solving real business problems. My main focus these
          days is building web app using well written code and strive to master
          modern front-end technologies or even become a full-stack dev.
        </p>
        <p className="text-xl mb-8">
          Aside from coding, I enjoy designing and developing digital products
          like creating animations and videos. I have a keen interest in new
          technologies, as well as in gaming, photography, videography, memes,
          and traveling to new and interesting places.
